## Meatball Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 2 cups quick-cooking oats
- 1 can (12 oz.) evaporated milk
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
- 3 lbs. hamburger

## Barbecue Sauce Ingredients
- 1 cup ketchup
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 cup onion

## Steps
In a large bowl, beat your eggs. Then add your oats, milk, onion, salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Then add the ground beef and mix well. Once you've mixed that all up shape in to balls. Place in a 13x9 baking pan (if you use a cooking sheet make sure it has sides). Bake uncovered 375&deg;F for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and drain. Place all the meatballs in one baking pan. In a sauce pan, bring all sauce ingredients to a boil. Pour over the meatballs. Return to the oven. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes or into meatballs are done.
